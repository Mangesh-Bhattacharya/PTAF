**AI-Driven Offensive + Defensive Security Automation for Mid-Level Practitioners**

Author: [Mangesh Bhattacharya](https://github.com/Mangesh-Bhattacharya) — Cybersecurity Practitioner | MITS-AI Graduate (Ontario Tech University) | Threat Intelligence & Automation

---

## Project Vision

PTAF is a free, open-source Purple Team automation framework built to help mid-level cybersecurity practitioners simulate real-world adversarial behavior, strengthen defensive controls, and accelerate security engineering workflows.

It is designed to run on Kali Linux, Ubuntu, and cloud shells, enabling practitioners to:

- Execute safe, controlled offensive simulations
- Automatically map defensive gaps
- Generate remediation guidance
- Produce Purple Team reports
- Collaborate with contributors from across the security community

The long-term goal is to make PTAF a practical, well-documented Purple Team automation toolkit for defenders, SOC analysts, threat hunters, and aspiring security engineers.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Offensive Simulation Modules (Safe & Controlled)

- Credential harvesting simulation (non-malicious)
- Phishing emulation
- Web application misconfiguration checks
- Cloud IAM misconfiguration detection
- Lateral movement path mapping
- Attack path visualization

### 2. Defensive Automation Modules

- Log correlation (SIEM-agnostic)
- MITRE ATT&CK mapping
- Alert quality scoring
- Detection gap identification
- Automated defensive recommendations
- Purple Team report generation (PDF/Markdown)

### 3. AI-Driven Analysis

- Threat pattern clustering
- Behavioral anomaly detection
- Automated defensive tuning suggestions
- Attack replay analysis

### 4. Collaboration Features

- Modular plugin system
- Clear contribution guidelines
- Issue templates for new modules
- Community roadmap
- Periodic "Purple Team Challenges" for contributors

## Technical Requirements

- **Language:** Python
- **OS:** Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Windows Subsystem for Linux
- **Dependencies:** Open-source libraries only
- **Architecture:** Modular, agent-based
- **Output formats:** JSON, Markdown, PDF
- **Integrations:** Sysmon, Suricata, Zeek, Sigma rules, MITRE ATT&CK

## Community & Collaboration

PTAF aims to be a collaboration point for SOC analysts, threat hunters, red teamers, blue teamers, purple teamers, and AI-security researchers.

Contributors are encouraged to:

- Add new modules
- Improve detection logic
- Submit Purple Team exercises
- Share defensive tuning strategies

## Installation (Kali Linux / Ubuntu / WSL)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mangesh-Bhattacharya/PTAF.git
cd PTAF
sudo chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

`install.sh` creates a virtual environment and installs `requirements.txt`.
For development (tests/lint), also install `requirements-dev.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

## Usage Example

```bash
# Run the offensive simulation stubs and print structured findings
python -m modules.offensive.emulation

# Check which simulated techniques currently have no detection rule
python -m modules.defensive.validate_detections

# Run the test suite
pytest
```

See [docs/example_workflow.md](docs/example_workflow.md) for a full walkthrough, and [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for how the modules fit together (with a diagram).

> **Status note:** PTAF is early-stage scaffolding. The capabilities listed
> above describe the intended architecture; each module currently ships
> the interface plus one or two fully-working, safe example
> implementations (not a complete, production SIEM/EDR/ML integration).
> See [Contributing](#contributing) to help build it out.
